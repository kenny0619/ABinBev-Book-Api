install all dependencies

You can add your env folder and file by creating a .env folder and a .env file in it. i already added some test configs in the config file so its not necessary
To run the app yarn start:dev:service

the router explorer (on the terminal) shows all the available endpoints.

i'll update with a postman link as soon as i submit
